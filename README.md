## CSE 572 DM Final Project (Group 19)
### Classification and Categorization of Cyberbullying across Social media platforms

With the increased use of social media platforms in recent years, it has become a platform for bullying and online harassment. CyberBullying, the act of bullying through digital and online communication channels has been a pertinent problem and, thereby needs to be addressed. Machine Learning (ML) can be used to identify patterns, language usage, and behavioral cues indicative of cases of CyberBullying by analyzing vast amounts of textual and visual data. This project is dedicated to utilizing a comprehensive cross-platform CyberBullying dataset to conduct a thorough evaluation of multiple ML classification models, with the objective of distinguishing between abusive and non-abusive content while categorizing the abusive content into specific contexts such as sexism, racism, toxicity, and more. The research uses a comprehensive and organized methodology that includes feature extraction techniques, rigorous preprocessing methods, and data collecting from many social media networks. Then, a variety of ML models are trained and evaluated in order to automate the recognition and accurate classification of CyberBullying content on the internet. The urgent need for potent solutions to stop online harassment and shield users from the damaging effects of CyberBullying is what spurs this research.
